# Step 1: Data Collection
# You can use historical price data from a cryptocurrency exchange
# For this example, let's assume you have a CSV file with price data
price_data = pd.read_csv('price_data.csv')

# Step 2: Data Preprocessing
# Clean and preprocess the data
price_data = price_data.dropna()

# Step 3: Feature Engineering
# Extract technical indicators as features
# For this example, let's use the simple moving average (SMA)
price_data['sma'] = price_data['close'].rolling(window=20).mean()

# Step 4: Model Selection
# Choose a machine learning model
model = RandomForestClassifier()

# Step 5: Training
# Split the data into training and testing sets
X = price_data[['sma']]
y = np.sign(price_data['close'].diff())
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Step 6: Evaluation
# Evaluate the model on the test dataset
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
print(f'Model accuracy: {accuracy}')

# Step 7: Execution
# Implement the model in a trading bot
exchange = bitmex()

# Connect to the exchange
exchange.load_markets()

# Get the current price
current_price = exchange.fetch_ticker('BTC/USD')['last']

# Get the SMA
sma = exchange.fetch_ticker('BTC/USD')['sma']

# Execute a trade based on the model's prediction
if model.predict([[sma]]) > 0:
    # Buy
    exchange.create_limit_buy_order('BTC/USD', 1, current_price)
else:
    # Sell
    exchange.create_limit_sell_order('BTC/USD', 1, current_price)
